# HYPERION - HYPer-fast close EncounteR Inference from Observations with Normalizing-flows 

HYPERION is pipeline for the detection and Parameter Estimation of gravitational waves from Close Encounters (see e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02143) based on Normalizing Flows (https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762)
